## The Origins of Los Cheles
 
Los Cheles were born in Madrid, in the neighborhood of Vallecas, where they grew up surrounded by music. Their cousins, Julio and Emilio GonzÃ¡lez, were part of Los Chichos, one of the most popular rumba bands in Spain. Los Cheles admired their cousins and wanted to follow their footsteps. They learned to play guitar and sing, and started to perform in bars and festivals.
 
In 1984, they got their first opportunity to record an album with Polydor, thanks to the support of Los Chichos. The album was called Cabibi, and it included songs like "Soy un Borracho", "DÃ©jame Vivir en Paz" and "Cabibi". The album was well received by the public and the critics, who praised their fresh and modern approach to rumba.
  
## The Success of Los Cheles
 
Los Cheles continued to record albums with Polydor until 1987, when they switched to Horus. Their second album, Hay Que Vivir, was released in 1985 and featured songs like "DesengaÃ±o", "Hay Que Vivir" and "No Te Quiero". Their third album, Que Pasa Contigo?, came out in 1987 and included hits like "Que Pasa Contigo?", "Caro Lo Estoy Pagando" and "Chica Bonita".
 
In 1988, they released their fourth album, Ritmo Guapo, which showed their versatility and creativity. They experimented with different styles and influences, such as pop, flamenco and Arabic music. Some of the songs were "Ritmo Guapo", "SeÃ±orita" and "Tengo Que Buscar La Fuerza". Their fifth album, Soleil, was released in 1989 and had a similar eclectic sound. Some of the songs were "Soleil", "Ella Es Mora" and "Vente Conmigo".
  
## The Legacy of Los Cheles
 
Los Cheles released their last album in 1990, titled Mis Primos Los Chichos. It was a tribute to their cousins and mentors, who had helped them throughout their career. The album featured covers of some of Los Chichos' most famous songs, such as "Ni MÃ¡s Ni Menos", "Quiero Ser Libre" and "Son Ilusiones". The album was a success and a sign of gratitude from Los Cheles to Los Chichos.
 
After that, Los Cheles decided to take a break from music and focus on their personal lives. They have not recorded any new albums since then, but they have occasionally performed live or collaborated with other artists. They have also participated in some documentaries and compilations about rumba music. Los Cheles are considered one of the most important rumba bands in Spain, and their songs are still played and enjoyed by many fans.
